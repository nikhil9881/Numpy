# Numpy
Welcome to the Numpy Repository! This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing Numpy library.

## Introduction
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these elements. 
NumPy is essential for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific research.

## Features
* Multi-dimensional arrays (`ndarray`): Efficient data structures for numerical operations.
* Mathematical functions: A wide range of mathematical functions for array operations.
* Broadcasting: Allows for operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes.
